Trying to create a landing page using flexbox.
First I will create a basic structure of the page using HTML
then I will try to style each section of the page one by one.

I have created a basic structure for the page in index.html.
But I have a confusion regarding which element to use for texts. At some places I have used p tags, at others I have used div tags. I don't know if I have to change this during styling with CSS.

Also I will have to edit the index.html again as required during stying: Creating new containers, assigning classes, etc.

Template design for the page:

I have not changed the placeholder texts at all as it wasn't significant and I have put random images of animals.
This page is not very responsive at the moment as I don't know that much.
